# Active-Learning-CXR-Classification
-   We propose a template-guided approach to incorporate the clinical knowledge of pneumothorax into model explanations generated by XAI methods, thereby enhancing the quality of these explanations.
> ### Please read our [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18871) for further information.

## Overview
-   Figure 1a shows the overview of our template guidance as a plug-and-play module for existing XAI methods.

## Code Usage
-   Supporting functions: `Classification_Functions.py` for classifier training, `Bootstrap_Functions.py` for calculating the standard devisation of model performance, `Uncertainty_Functions` for computing model uncertainty based on Monte Carlo simulations.
-   Diversity-based initialization sample selection: `Diversity TXRV`, `Diversity REMEDIS`, `Diversity Dense121`, `Diversity Res152` is based on TXRV, REMEDIS, Dense121, and Res152, respectively.
-   Uncertainty-based initialization sample selection: `Uncertainty TXRV`, `Uncertainty REMEDIS`, `Uncertainty Dense121`, `Uncertainty Res152` is based on TXRV, REMEDIS, Dense121, and Res152, respectively.
-   Hybrid-based initialization sample selection: `Hybrid TXRV`, `Hybrid REMEDIS`, `Hybrid Dense121`, `Hybrid Res152` is based on TXRV, REMEDIS, Dense121, and Res152, respectively.
